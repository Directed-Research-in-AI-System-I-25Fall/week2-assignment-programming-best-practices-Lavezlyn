# What I have learned
## Git & Github
1. Create or delete a branch locally and remotely require different commands. 
2. **git reset \<commit hash\>** is different from **git checkout \<commit hash\>**
3. Do not commit unless you've fully considered.
## Huggingface
1. Pre-trained model may perform badly on another task, even it seems simple.
2. Playing with inference API.
3. Fine-tune basics.
## Others
Read handout as carefully as possible.
