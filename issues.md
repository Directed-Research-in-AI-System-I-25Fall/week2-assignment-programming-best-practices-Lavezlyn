To my best knowledge, there's no way to verify my completion of STEP 9 and STEP 10 by checking commits history remotely at github.
Although I 'git push --force origin main' every time after resetting, I fail to see the changes displayed accordingly in the remote repo.
However, snapshots during STEP 9 and STEP 10 opearations are added to this repo after the assignment was done for your reference.
Any further explanations of this problem are welcome.
